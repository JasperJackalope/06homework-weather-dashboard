# Homework 06 - Weather Dashboard

## Description

For this assignment, I was tasked with building a website from scratch to act as a Weather Dashboard, where a user can search a city and get the current weather along with a five day forecast.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The user will be presented with a webpage displaying the current date at the top of the screen along with entry row for each hour between 9 am and 6 pm. Each row is color coded to be a past hour (gray), present hour (red), and a future hour (green). In the screenshot below, the example is set to 2 pm to indicate the color scheme.

To add an entry, simply click in the row for the desired hour, add the text, and click the blue save button at the far right of the row. The entry is now saved and upon refreshing the website, the entry will remain. To delete the entry, click in the row, deleted the desired text, and click save again.

## Credits

Big thank you to my friends, coders, and personal tutors Cameron Gibson and Daniel Batch for walking me through this one and assisting with the data mining. I used starter code for the JavaScript from GitHub, where I was able to refactor and build out the rest of the application. The styling is all me, taking inspiration from a Caboodles makeup organizer. Trusty W3 Schools helped to fill in some gaps and trusty Chat GBT was used when I was very, very stuck. 

Finally, big thanks to my classmates and our fearless leaders Bryan and Shawn.
